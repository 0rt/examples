This is some basic analysis using the Mushrooms data set from Kaggle. [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). 

The problem is to determine toxicity of a mushroom based on its described features. A classification tree has very good accuracy, and most of the toxicity can be determined via smell. Unfortunately, the species of mushroom from the data set are very limited in diversity, so this cannot be generalized to mushrooms in general.
